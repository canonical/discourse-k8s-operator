# Charmed Discourse K8s Documentation

This charm simplifies initial deployment and "day N" operations of Discourse
on Kubernetes, such as scaling the number of instances, integration with SSO,
access to S3 for redundant file storage and more. It allows for deployment on
many different Kubernetes platforms, from [MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io) or
[Charmed Kubernetes](https://ubuntu.com/kubernetes) to public cloud Kubernetes
offerings.

Discourse is an open-source software application used to create customer-friendly and community-friendly discussion platforms, forums, and mailing lists. It's designed to work as a discussion platform for various topics and is widely used by numerous organizations and individuals to build communities, provide customer support, and facilitate conversations. The platform is built with a focus on simplicity, user-friendliness, and responsiveness, making it accessible from both desktops and mobile devices. Discourse provides various moderation and administration tools, enabling community managers to maintain a healthy and constructive environment.
