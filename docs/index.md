Discourse is a from-scratch reboot, an attempt to reimagine what a modern Internet discussion forum should be today, in a world of ubiquitous smartphones, tablets, Facebook, and Twitter. See [this page](https://www.discourse.org/about) for more details about what's different about Discourse. And for a list of the features of Discourse, see [this page](https://www.discourse.org/features).

Discourse is a JavaScript application that runs in your web browser, using the [Ember.js](https://emberjs.com/) framework. The server side of Discourse is [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) backed by a [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) database and [Redis](https://redis.io/) cache.
