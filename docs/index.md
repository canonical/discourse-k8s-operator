A [Juju](https://juju.is/) [charm](https://juju.is/docs/olm/charmed-operators)
 deploying and managing [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/) on Kubernetes. Discourse is the 100% open source discussion platform. Use it as a mailing list, discussion  forum or long-form chat room.

This charm simplifies initial deployment and "day N" operations of Discourse on Kubernetes, such as scaling the number of instances, integration with SSO, access to S3 for redundant file storage and more. It allows for deployment on many different Kubernetes platforms, from [MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io) or [Charmed Kubernetes](https://ubuntu.com/kubernetes) and public cloud Kubernetes offerings.

As such, the charm makes it easy for those looking to take control of their own discussion platform whilst keeping operations simple, and gives them the freedom to deploy on the Kubernetes platform of their choice.
 
For DevOps or SRE teams this charm will make operating Discourse simple and
 straightforward through Juju's clean interface. It will allow easy deployment
 into multiple environments for testing of changes, and supports scaling out for
 enterprise deployments.
