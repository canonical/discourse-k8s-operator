# Getting started

In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of deploying the Discourse charm, relating it to the nginx-ingress-integrator charm, the postgresql-k8s charm and the redis-k8s charm, and inspecting the kubernetes resources created.

## Requirements

You will need:

* A laptop or desktop running Ubuntu (or you can use a VM).
* [Juju and Microk8s](https://juju.is/docs/olm/microk8s) installed. Weâ€™ll also want to make sure the ingress add-on is enabled, which we can do by running `microk8s enable ingress`.

## Deploy this charm

Discourse requires connections to PostgreSQL and Redis, so those will be deployed too and related to the Discourse charm. For more information, see the [Charm Architecture](https://charmhub.io/discourse-k8s/docs/charm-architecture).

All the above charms will the deployed in a new model named `discourse`:

```
# Add the model
juju add-model discourse

# Deploy the charms
juju deploy redis-k8s
juju deploy postgresql-k8s --channel latest/stable
juju deploy discourse-k8s

# Relate redis-k8s and postgresql-k8s to discourse-k8s
juju relate redis-k8s discourse-k8s
# For postgresql-k8s the "db" interface needs to be specified as the charm provides more than one
juju relate discourse-k8s postgresql-k8s:db

```

By running `juju status --relations` the current state of the deployment can be queried, with all the charms eventually reaching `Active`state:
```

```

Run `kubectl get pods -n discourse` to see the pods that are being created by the charms:
```

discourse-k8s-0                  2/2     Running   0          9m

```

In order to expose the charm, the Nginx Ingress Integrator is to be deployed alongside Discourse to provide ingress capabilities

```
juju deploy nginx-ingress-integrator
# If your cluster has RBAC enabled you'll be prompted to run the following:
juju trust nginx-ingress-integrator --scope=cluster

juju relate discourse-k8s nginx-ingress-integrator
```

Discourse will be deployed with `discourse-k8s` as default hostname. In order to reach it, modify your `/etc/hosts` file so that it points to `127.0.0.1`

`echo 127.0.0.1 discourse-k8s >> /etc/hosts`

After that, visit `http://discourse-k8s` to reach Discourse.

This charm allows you to add a admin user by executing the corresponding action. Instead of interacting with the Discourse UI just run `juju run-action discourse-k8s/0 add-admin-user email=email@example.com password=somepwd --wait` and it will be registered and validated.
