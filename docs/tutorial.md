# Getting started

In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of deploying the Discourse charm, relating it to the nginx-ingress-integrator charm, the postgresql-k8s charm and the redis-k8s charm, and inspecting the kubernetes resources created.

## Requirements

You will need:

* A laptop or desktop running Ubuntu (or you can use a VM).
* [Juju and Microk8s](https://juju.is/docs/olm/microk8s) installed. Weâ€™ll also want to make sure the ingress add-on is enabled, which we can do by running `microk8s enable ingress`.

## Deploy this charm

Discourse requires connections to PostgreSQL and Redis, so those will be deployed too and related to the Discourse charm. For more information, see the [Charm Architecture](https://charmhub.io/discourse-k8s/docs/charm-architecture).
Note that Discourse requires PostgreSQL extensions to be available in the relation.

All the above charms will the deployed in a new model named `discourse`:

```
# Add the model
juju add-model discourse

# Deploy the charms
juju deploy redis-k8s --channel latest/edge
juju deploy postgresql-k8s --channel 14/stable --trust
juju deploy discourse-k8s

# Enable required PostgreSQL extensions
juju config postgresql-k8s plugin_hstore_enable=True
juju config postgresql-k8s plugin_pg_trgm_enable=True

# Relate redis-k8s and postgresql-k8s to discourse-k8s
juju relate redis-k8s discourse-k8s
juju relate discourse-k8s postgresql-k8s

```

By running `juju status --relations` the current state of the deployment can be queried, with all the charms eventually reaching `Active`state:
```

```

Run `kubectl get pods -n discourse` to see the pods that are being created by the charms:
```
NAME                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
modeloperator-64c58d675d-csj47   1/1     Running   0          5m30s

postgresql-k8s-0                 2/2     Running   0          5m9s
```

In order to expose the charm, the Nginx Ingress Integrator is to be deployed alongside Discourse to provide ingress capabilities

```
juju deploy nginx-ingress-integrator
# If your cluster has RBAC enabled you'll be prompted to run the following:
juju trust nginx-ingress-integrator --scope=cluster

juju relate discourse-k8s nginx-ingress-integrator
```

To create an admin user, run:
```
juju run discourse-k8s/0 create-user admin=true email=email@example.com
```
The command will return the password of the created user. Discourse will be deployed with `discourse-k8s` as default hostname. In order to reach it, modify your `/etc/hosts` file so that it points to `127.0.0.1`

`echo 127.0.0.1 discourse-k8s >> /etc/hosts`

After that, visit `http://discourse-k8s` to reach Discourse, using the credentials returned from the `create-user` action to login.
